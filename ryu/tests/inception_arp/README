Usage on scripts:

compute_ip.txt: the list of IPs of all compute nodes.
vm_ip.txt: the list of IPs of all VMs.
util.sh: get_vm_ip(): generate above list. Used only when new VMs are changed.
common.py: python utility modules, e.g. eval commonds parallelization
network_tune.sh: set up mtu on br2 on each compute nodes, and setuid on arping on each vm.
check_alive.sh: check whether target VMs are alive (ping-able).
copy_to_vm: deploy test script to VMs, only used when new hosts are added or need to change the script.
start_ping.sh: start ping on all host.
stop_ping.sh stop ping on all host.
collect_data.sh: collect data when test finished.
gen_latency.sh: generate latency data from the data collected from collect_data.sh. 
		Write 3 types of files
		<test_name>.all: all latency data
		<test_name>.inter_host: latency data including data between different compute nodes.
		<test_name>.inter_dc: only latency data between data center.

typical test procedure:

make sure ssh connection is setup. 

0) util.sh & compute_ip.txt & vm_ip.txt & network_tune.sh & check_alive.sh & copy_to_vm.sh (run_test.sh calc_exp vm_ip.txt)

1) start_ping.sh 

.... wait for some time .....

2) stop_ping.sh

3) collect_data.sh

4) gen_latency.sh

5) cleanup_ping.sh (optional)
